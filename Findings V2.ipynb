The percentage of women with a degree in Engineering increases from 30% to 43% for the oldest and youngest demographics, respectively.  Over time the percentage of 25-39 year olds with a degree in Engineering has been flat for males and grown from 42% in 2013 to 43% in 2016.  While the growth hasn't been dramatic over the past four years, it does indicate a positive trend."
